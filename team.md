* Jean-Philippe Villemin - Bioinformatician

	Previously, I spent three years studying the role of alternative splicing in tumoral progession, for which I developped algorithms and databases to analyze and store microarray data. I then moved into the medical field, where I was in charge of the developpment of an application to centralize and display data for clinicians. That was followed by a year dedicated to the study of rare diseases where I was mostly involved in alignment and variant calling workflows. As of september 2016, I have joined the Luco laboratory at the IGH in Montpellier, France.  

	My current focus is on the role of epigenetics in the regulation of cell-type-specific alternative splicing programs. Our cellular model is the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is involved in early development, tumour progression and metastasis. Our goal is to demonstrate the dynamic role of histone modifications in the establishment and maintenance of an alternative splicing program and identify novel chromatin marks involved in its regulation. In this context, we have generated RNA-seq and Chip-seq data at key time-points that are in need of analysis. 

	Personally, Iâ€™m a 33 years old bionformatician and recently proud father of a magnificent little girl. In September, because of my love of challenges, I will be starting a PhD in my current laboratory.
