Alternative splicing is one of the most general and important biological processes in the eukaryotic cell. It affects more than 90% of human genes, it is essential for protein diversity and any misregulation of the highly tissue-specific alternative splicing programs can lead to disease, such as cancer. However the mechanisms of cell-specific alternative splicing regulation are still largely unknown. 

Unexpectedly, in the past 15 years, chromatin and epigenetic modifications have been shown to play an important role in the regulation of alternative splicing. 
In particular, we have shown that non-coding RNAs and histone marks can talk to the splicing machinery via recruitment of chromatin/splicing-adaptor complexes. 

Our group aims at the better understanding of the role of epigenetics and long non-coding RNAs in the onset and maintenance of tissue-specific splicing programs using as a cell redifferentiation model system the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). For that purpose we will use chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and genome-wide strand-specific RT and ChIP deep-sequencing to depict the molecular mechanisms of regulation of tissue-specific alternative splicing.
