* POSTDOC POSITION

...A postdoctoral position is available at the group of Reini Luco at the Institut de Génétique Humaine in Montpellier, in the South of France. 

...Luco’s lab works on the role of chromatin and long non-coding RNAs in the regulation of cell-specific alternative splicing (for more details ...see Gonzalez et al., Nat. Str. Mol. Biol 2015 22(5):370-6 and Luco et al., Science 2010 327(5968):996-1000). 

...The project aims at identifying novel chromatin regulators involved in the regulation of alternative splicing using as a model system the dynamic and inducible Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). By using proteomics, we will identify unsuspected new chromatin regulators that interact with the splicing machinery and test their effect on EMT-specific splicing and EMT progression itself. 

...We are looking for very motivated, hard-working and creative candidates with strong background in molecular biology. Previous expertise in splicing and/or epigenetics will be positively evaluated.

...Please provide a detailed CV with a list of publications and expertise, a letter of motivation and the names and contacts of two referees to Reini Luco,
